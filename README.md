## About

> <a href="https://github.com/FN-2189/SCS" color="#b32835">SCS</a> is a space battle simulator with near-future technology setting aiming to achieve relatively realistic space combat. It is a open source game made in the Unity game engine. Almost all assets and all scripts were created by us. <br>

## Planned Features

> In order to achieve a relatively realistic simulation, this game is planned to take place in a 1/1 scale recreation of our solar system. Navigation is simulated using gravity and realistic thrust control. Multiplayer is planned, but is not yet implemented (we first need to create the core systems). Combat mainly uses missiles and kinetic weaponry like Point-Defence-Cannons and Railguns. Lasers are currently not planned for combatative purposes, as they would require a very large amount of commitment to respective counter measures that would influence the overall setting in an unrealistic way, however particle weapons are up for consideration.<br>
Ship systems are planned to be fully simulated and react to individual damages. Different weapon types have different damage models that damage ship modules in a realistic way.<br>
The game takes place in first person exclusively, and players interact with the ship through screens and diegetic menus. This makes different roles and multicrew operation an option.
